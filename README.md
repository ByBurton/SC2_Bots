# SC2_Bots
My bots for sc2


This is a library of all my bot scripts. I began coding sc2 ai, because I wanted to create an ai for my custom sc2 campaign.
But as I learned, I can not include my ai in custom maps just like that. So I guess... this is kinda dead.

But this may help others. There are some useful functions in here, thanks to all the people on the python-sc2 discord channel, especially lladdy, Matuiss2, Frigerius, h3nnn4n.

Issues can still be called out, maybe I will fix them.
