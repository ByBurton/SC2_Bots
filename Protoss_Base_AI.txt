Basic idea:
-Not aggressive until 200 / 200 cap is reached. (MAYBE: And even then only sends in "waves" of units. If possible. like in campaigns.)
-Completely not competitive. Just4Fun.
-Big bases. Each expansion should be big (have each building once, and some defenses), and the main base extra big (each building once, twice later on, a lot of photon cannons and shield batteries)
-economy focus. very early expansions
-observer rush. not scouting the enemy, but the border of its part of the map
-defends its base, but does not attack, look at idea 1
(-MAYBE: does not defend one base with all its units, always keeps some at each other base)
-about static defenses: I want them kind of around the bases, is that somehow possible? like a border of some sort. and for each two photon cannons put one shield barrier behind them. ?
-randomly chooses one kind of unit that it focuses on, still builds others, but in very few numbers. e.g. regular ground units (zealots and stalkers), special units (psi wizard dudes), 
	invis (dark templar), mech (robotic facility units) or air (void rays)
-ability to surrender if main nexus has fallen or no pylons are left (why? because I say so :P)
